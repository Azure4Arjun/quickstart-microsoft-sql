This deployment includes AWS Secrets Manager, which isn’t currently supported in all AWS Regions. For a current list of supported regions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/asm.html[Service Endpoints and Quotas] in the AWS documentation. Also, if you’re planning to deploy an architecture with three Availability Zones, choose an AWS Region that supports three zones.

If using non-default settings, including dedicated hosts for the SQL servers and an FSx file share for the file share witness, see the AWS documentation to ensure regional compatibility.
