==============

This reference implementation guide includes architectural considerations and configuration steps for running Microsoft Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) clusters in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. We discuss how to launch the necessary AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), and how to run a WSFC cluster across different subnets and Availability Zones. Then we provide instructions for installing, configuring, and testing the WSFC cluster and a SQL Server 2012 or 2014 AlwaysOn Availability Group.
